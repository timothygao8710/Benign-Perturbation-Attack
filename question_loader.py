A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulties having sexual intercourse due to erectile dysfunction. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus that is well controlled with metformin. He does not smoke. He drinks 5â€“6 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows bilateral pedal edema, decreased testicular volume, and increased breast tissue. The spleen is palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. Abdominal ultrasound shows an atrophic, hyperechoic, nodular liver. An upper endoscopy is performed and shows dilated submucosal veins 2 mm in diameter with red spots on their surface in the distal esophagus. Therapy with a sildenafil is initiated for his erectile dysfunction. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's esophageal findings?

Choices -
A Injection sclerotherapy
B Nadolol therapy
C Losaratan therapy
D Octreotide therapy
E Isosorbide mononitrate therapy
F Endoscopic band ligation
G Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
H Metoprolol therapy

Question -

A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because his teachers have noticed him staring blankly on multiple occasions over the past month. These episodes last for several seconds and occasionally his eyelids flutter. He was born at term and has no history of serious illness. He has met all his developmental milestones. He appears healthy. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Hyperventilation for 30 seconds precipitates an episode of unresponsiveness and eyelid fluttering that lasts for 7 seconds. He regains consciousness immediately afterward. An electroencephalogram shows 3-Hz spikes and waves. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Choices -

A Vigabatrin
B Lamotrigine
C Pregabalin
D Clonazepam
E Carbamazepine
F Ethosuximide
G Phenytoin
H Levetiracetam
